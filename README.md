# ðŸ”¥ Fire Classification Using Deep Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on the **automatic detection of fire** in images using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**. Early fire detection is crucial for preventing damage to life and property, especially in forests, buildings, and industrial areas. The model classifies input images into two categories: **Fire** and **No Fire**, providing a fast and intelligent solution for fire safety systems.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Build a robust image classification model that can distinguish between fire and non-fire images.
- Train the model using a labeled dataset and optimize it for high accuracy.
- Deploy the model for real-time prediction and integration into practical safety systems.

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **OpenCV**
- **NumPy & Pandas**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- *(Optional: Flask / Streamlit / IBM Watson Studio for deployment)*
